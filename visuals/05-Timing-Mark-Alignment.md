# Timing Mark Alignment Visual Guide

## Critical Concept: Why Timing Marks Matter

**Simple explanation:**
Timing marks ensure the camshaft and crankshaft are synchronized. If they're not aligned, the engine won't start or will run very poorly.

## Visual Reference

### What Are Timing Marks?

```
CAMSHAFT GEAR:           CRANKSHAFT GEAR:
┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
│    ⊙        │          │    ⊙        │
│  TOOTH      │          │  TOOTH      │
│   GEAR      │          │   GEAR      │
└─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
     ▲ Timing Mark            ▲ Timing Mark
     (usually a dot)          (usually a line)

WHEN CORRECTLY ALIGNED:

Camshaft gear mark:  ●
                     │
                     │ ALIGN
                     │
Crankshaft gear mark: ─ ─ ─

In Reality:
     Camshaft Gear
     ┌────●────┐
     │         │
   ──┼─────────┼──────── Reference Line
     │         │
     └────┴────┘
     Crankshaft Gear
```

## Before Disassembly (CRITICAL!)

### Step 1: Photograph Timing Marks

**BEFORE you remove the camshaft, do this:**

```
1. Look at the camshaft gear (inside the engine)
2. Look at the crankshaft gear (also inside)
3. Find the marks (usually painted dots or notches)
4. Take a CLEAR PHOTO showing both marks aligned
5. Write down the positions in words

Example Photo Notes:
  "Camshaft gear dot is at 2 o'clock position"
  "Crankshaft gear line is at 8 o'clock position"
  "They are parallel/aligned when viewed from side"
```

### Step 2: Mark the Gears

```
Use paint pen or marker to make a line connecting:
  - The camshaft gear mark
  - The crankshaft gear mark
  - The engine block

This creates a visual reference that shows:
  "These marks should all line up again"

Example:
     ┌──────●───────┐  Camshaft
     │    MARK      │
     │      │       │
     │      │       │  (paint line)
     │      │       │
     │      ▼       │
     └──────────────┘
          ▼ Paint line down engine block
          │
          │
          ▼
     ┌───────────────┐
     │      ─        │  Crankshaft
     │     MARK      │
     └───────────────┘
```

## During Reassembly (CRITICAL!)

### Step 1: Verify Starting Position

```
Before you insert the camshaft:

1. Look at both gears inside the engine
2. Are they still at the alignment position?
3. If not, rotate crankshaft until they ARE aligned
4. This is your reference position

Position: "Camshaft hole at _____, Crankshaft hole at _____"
```

### Step 2: Install Camshaft Aligned

```
When reinstalling camshaft:

1. Camshaft gear should align with the mark you made
2. The paint line should show alignment
3. Verify before tightening bolts

Visual Check:
     ┌─────●─────┐  Camshaft (gear mark aligned)
     │           │
 ────┼───────────┼────  Paint line (should be straight)
     │           │
     ┌─────┴─────┐  Crankshaft (gear mark aligned)
     │           │
     ├─────────────Engine block
```

### Step 3: Rotate and Re-Verify

```
CRITICAL: After tightening camshaft bolts:

1. Manually rotate engine by crankshaft
2. After 1 full rotation (360°):
   - Marks should realign
   - Paint line should still be straight

3. Do it again:
   - Rotate another 360°
   - Marks should realign again
   - Paint line should still be straight

If marks DON'T stay aligned:
  ✗ WRONG - Something is off
  ✗ Timing marks are shifting
  ✗ STOP and troubleshoot

If marks DO stay aligned:
  ✓ CORRECT - Proceed to next phase
```

## Documentation

### What to Record

```
TIMING MARK VERIFICATION LOG:

Before Disassembly:
  Camshaft gear mark position: _______________
  Crankshaft gear mark position: _______________
  Photo taken: ☑ Yes

Before Installing Camshaft:
  Mark alignment verified: ☑ Yes
  Paint line visible: ☑ Yes

After Camshaft Installation:
  Rotation Test 1 (360°):
    Marks realigned? ☑ Yes ☐ No
    Paint line straight? ☑ Yes ☐ No

  Rotation Test 2 (another 360°):
    Marks realigned? ☑ Yes ☐ No
    Paint line straight? ☑ Yes ☐ No

Final Status:
  ☑ Timing marks correctly aligned
  ☑ Ready to proceed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Marks Don't Align During Reassembly

```
Diagnosis: Camshaft not positioned correctly

Solution:
1. Remove camshaft mounting bolts (don't fully remove)
2. Rotate camshaft gear to align with mark
3. Tighten bolts gradually
4. Rotate engine to verify alignment holds
5. If still wrong, troubleshoot gear ratio
```

### Problem: Marks Shift During Rotation

```
Diagnosis: Camshaft or crankshaft loose

Solution:
1. Stop immediately
2. Check all camshaft bolts (tighten if loose)
3. Check connecting rod bolts (tighten if loose)
4. Verify engine rotates smoothly
5. Re-test alignment through full rotations
```

### Problem: Can't See Timing Marks

```
Solution:
1. Use flashlight to look inside engine
2. Wipe away any oil or debris
3. Look for painted dot or line on gears
4. If still can't find, ask instructor
5. May need to use reference marks you created
```

## Why This Is Critical

```
IF TIMING MARKS ARE WRONG:

Camshaft opens/closes valves at wrong times
        │
        ▼
Fuel enters cylinder at wrong time
        │
        ▼
Compression cycle is disrupted
        │
        ▼
Engine won't start OR
Engine runs very poorly
        │
        ▼
You troubleshoot for hours wondering why

----

IF TIMING MARKS ARE CORRECT:

Camshaft opens/closes valves at RIGHT times
        │
        ▼
Fuel enters cylinder at CORRECT time
        │
        ▼
Compression cycle is perfect
        │
        ▼
Engine starts on first try
Engine runs smoothly
        │
        ▼
You understand why timing matters!
```

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Use during reassembly:**

```
TIMING VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:

Before Disassembly:
  ☑ Timing marks photographed
  ☑ Positions documented
  ☑ Paint line created
  ☑ Everything saved for reference

Before Camshaft Installation:
  ☑ Gears verified at starting position
  ☑ Paint line visible
  ☑ Camshaft aligned with mark

After Camshaft Installation:
  ☑ Camshaft bolts tightened
  ☑ Engine rotates freely
  ☑ Rotation test 1 passed (360°)
  ☑ Rotation test 2 passed (360°)
  ☑ Marks remain aligned at all positions

Ready to Proceed:
  ☑ All tests passed
  ☑ Instructor verified
  ☑ Documented in worksheet
```
