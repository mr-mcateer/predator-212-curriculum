# 📊 Visual Guides & Critical Procedures

This folder contains visual references for the most critical procedures. Visual demonstrations come primarily from Mr. Hall's video series.

## 🎬 CRITICAL PROCEDURES - WATCH THE VIDEOS

### **Valve Lash Adjustment (MOST CRITICAL)**

**File:** [04-Valve-Lash-Guide.md](04-Valve-Lash-Guide.md)

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 7 (8:55) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixVMH0u7C34

**Why it matters:** Improper valve lash is the #1 reason engines don't start after rebuild.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to position engine at Top Dead Center
- How to use a feeler gauge correctly
- The exact gap specifications (intake 0.003-0.005", exhaust 0.004-0.006")
- How to adjust the rocker arms

**What to do:**
1. Read this guide completely
2. Watch the video at least 2 times
3. Watch while you're actually doing the procedure
4. Have your instructor verify your measurements before proceeding

### **Timing Mark Alignment (CRITICAL)**

**File:** [05-Timing-Mark-Alignment.md](05-Timing-Mark-Alignment.md)

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 4 (15:24) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sKIi20SJNI

**Why it matters:** If timing marks don't align, engine won't compress or start.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to photograph timing marks BEFORE you disassemble
- What correct alignment looks like
- How to verify alignment through a full engine rotation
- Troubleshooting if marks don't line up

**What to do:**
1. Read this guide completely
2. Watch the video's timing section
3. Photograph your engine's timing marks at the start of disassembly
4. Use those photos to verify alignment during reassembly

## 📹 USING VIDEOS AS YOUR PRIMARY VISUAL REFERENCE

Mr. Hall's videos are your primary visual resource. They show:

- **Part 1-2:** Component removal and disassembly sequences
- **Part 3:** Piston ring installation and gap verification
- **Part 4:** Internal assembly, timing marks, torque sequences
- **Part 5-6:** Head and valve procedures with close-up views
- **Part 7:** Valve lash adjustment (watch 2-3 times)
- **Part 8:** Exterior reassembly and fuel system setup
- **Part 9:** Flywheel installation and tightness

**Best practice:** Watch the relevant video while you're working on each section.

## 🖨️ PRINTING & USING GUIDES

**Print these guides for your workstation:**

1. [04-Valve-Lash-Guide.md](04-Valve-Lash-Guide.md) - Print and laminate if possible
2. [05-Timing-Mark-Alignment.md](05-Timing-Mark-Alignment.md) - Print and post at workstation

**Also print from docs/ folder:**
- [docs/01-Quick-Reference-Checklists.md](../docs/01-Quick-Reference-Checklists.md) - Safety and procedure checklists

## ✅ CRITICAL PROCEDURES CHECKLIST

Before starting major assembly phases:

```
VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT (Week 4-5, Tuesday Block):
☐ Read 04-Valve-Lash-Guide.md completely
☐ Watch Mr. Hall Part 7 at least 2 times
☐ Have guide printed and at workstation
☐ Record measurements in worksheet
☐ Get instructor verification before proceeding

TIMING ALIGNMENT (Week 4-5, Thursday Block):
☐ Photographed timing marks at start of disassembly
☐ Reviewed 05-Timing-Mark-Alignment.md
☐ Verified marks align at Top Dead Center
☐ Verified marks align at Half-Rotation
☐ Confirmed with instructor
```

## 🎓 WHY THESE ARE CRITICAL

**Valve Lash Adjustment:**
- Incorrect gap = valves don't open/close properly
- Too tight = valves don't open at all
- Too loose = compression loss and poor performance
- This is the #1 cause of startup failure

**Timing Marks:**
- Misalignment = internal collision
- Bent valves
- Engine won't run
- Cannot be fixed without partial disassembly

**Torque Specifications:**
- Too tight = aluminum threads strip
- Too loose = components come apart
- Inconsistent = leaks and failures
- Use a torque wrench, not feel

## 📝 DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

For each critical procedure in your notebook, write:

1. **Date completed**
2. **Actual measurements** (not what the guide says, what YOU measured)
3. **Any adjustments made** and why
4. **Issues encountered** and how you resolved them
5. **Instructor verification** (initials and date)
