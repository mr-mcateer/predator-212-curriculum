## 📍 What You're Actually Doing

### **The Big Picture**

You're going to:
1. **Take apart** a complete Predator 212 engine (down to individual components)
2. **Inspect** each part to understand what it does
3. **Measure** components to verify they're within specifications
4. **Put it back together** in precise order
5. **Adjust** critical components so the engine runs correctly
6. **Start the engine** and verify it works

### **Why This Matters**

This is **authentic work** that real mechanics do every day. You're not just learning about engines - you're actually rebuilding one.

---

## 🔴 Non-Negotiable Safety Rules

**These aren't suggestions. These are requirements.**

### **Before You Start Anything**

```
☑ Spark plug is removed (not just disconnected)
☑ All fuel is drained from carburetor
☑ All oil is drained (both drain plugs)
☑ Engine is COLD (not running for 30+ minutes)
☑ Workstation is clean and organized
☑ You have first aid kit nearby
☑ Fire extinguisher is accessible
☑ You're NOT working alone (instructor or partner present)
```

### **During Work**

```
☑ Safety glasses are worn
☑ Oily rags go in disposal container (not in trash)
☑ Spilled oil is cleaned immediately (slip hazard)
☑ Tools are used correctly (not improvised)
☑ You ask before trying something new
☑ You stop immediately if something feels wrong
```

### **STOP Work Immediately If:**

```
🔴 You're unsure about a procedure
🔴 You hear rod knock during startup (rapid metal-on-metal clicking)
🔴 You see fuel leaking
🔴 You see oil leaking where there shouldn't be
🔴 You can't get something to fit properly
🔴 Someone asks you to skip a safety step
```

```

**Your job:** Be methodical, take photos, label everything, DOCUMENT EVERYTHING

**Critical Documentation:**
- Photograph every component position
- Record where each bolt came from
- Measure ring gaps and bore
- Note component condition
- **Record ALL valve lash attempts** (not just successful ones)
- Document actual torque values used (not just specs)

---

### **Weeks 4-5: Reassembly (The Important Part)**

```
Week 4:
  Day 1-2: Head reassembly (valves, springs, head bolts)
  Day 3: ⭐ VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT ⭐ (Most critical!)
  Day 4-5: Internal assembly (camshaft, crankcase cover)

Week 5:
  Day 1-2: Flywheel and external components
  Day 3-4: Carburetor and fuel system
  Day 5:   Pre-startup verification
           (Instructor sign-off before startup)

Your job: Precision work - measure, document, verify
```

**⭐ SPECIAL ATTENTION TO VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT:**
This is THE most critical procedure. Poor valve lash = engine won't run right.
- Watch Mr. Hall Part 7 at least 2 times
- Follow the procedure exactly
- Record every measurement
- Get your instructor to verify

---

### **Week 6: Startup & Reflection**

```
Monday:  Final assembly checks + pre-startup verification
         Review Part 8 & 9: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6wgEWFvBWQ
         and https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t-kKTW-2ZqE
Tuesday: First startup! 🚀 (Nervousness is normal)
         Document: # of pulls, engine behavior, sounds, any issues
Wednesday: Troubleshooting if needed
         Reference: docs/FAQ.md for diagnosis
         If won't start: Check spark → fuel → VALVE LASH (most common)
Thursday-Friday: Complete reflection + finalize documentation
```

**Your job:** Document the startup process, learn from what happened

**If engine won't start:**
- Check these in order: Spark → Fuel → Valve Lash (80% of problems)
- See: docs/FAQ.md for complete troubleshooting
- Part 7 video (valve lash): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixVMH0u7C34

## ⚙ Critical Concepts You Need to Know

### **Torque (NOT just "tight")**

Don't guess. Torque wrench = precision.
- Too tight = broken threads (aluminum is delicate)
- Too loose = parts falling off during startup
- Correct = engine works, nothing breaks

[Reference: docs/05-Torque-Specifications.md](docs/05-Torque-Specifications.md)

### **Valve Lash (Open + Close gap)**

This controls when valves open and close.
- Too tight = valves don't fully open (engine weak)
- Too loose = valves don't fully close (compression loss)
- Perfect = engine purrs

This is why we emphasize it so much.

### **Timing Marks (Everything aligns here)**

Before you disassemble, photograph the timing marks.
When you reassemble, align them exactly the same way.
Engine timing controls everything.

### **Ring Gaps (Measured in thousandths of an inch)**

Piston rings must have exact gaps.
- Too tight = rings stick (bad)
- Too loose = compression loss (bad)
- Just right = engine works (good)

---

## 🎯 Success Factors

### **Students Who Succeed:**
✅ Follow procedures exactly (don't skip steps)
✅ Use torque wrench for critical bolts
✅ Document everything carefully
✅ Ask questions when unsure
✅ Photograph component positions
✅ Complete valve lash adjustment properly
✅ Don't rush the process
✅ Keep workspace organized

### **Students Who Struggle:**
❌ Skip safety procedures
❌ Guess at torque values
❌ Rush through reassembly
❌ Don't record measurements
❌ Ignore unusual sounds during startup
❌ Skip valve lash verification
❌ Try to work alone
❌ Don't reference guides while working

---

## 🛠 Tools You'll Need

Your instructor should have these, but verify:

```
☑ Metric socket set (especially 8mm, 10mm)
☑ Torque wrench (0-30 ft-lbs range)
☑ Feeler gauge set
☑ Spark plug socket (13/16")
☑ Adjustable wrenches
☑ Screwdrivers (Phillips and flat)
☑ Rubber mallet
☑ Gasket scraper
☑ Shop towels (LOTS)
☑ Catch pans for fluids
☑ Compressed air
☑ Camera or phone (for photos)
```

## ❓ Common Questions

### **Q: What if I mess something up?**
A: Tell your instructor immediately. Most things can be fixed. Hiding problems causes bigger problems.

### **Q: What if the engine doesn't start?**
A: That's actually a learning opportunity. We'll troubleshoot together.

### **Q: Can I skip the valve lash adjustment?**
A: No. This is non-negotiable. Engine won't run right without it.

### **Q: What if I don't have time to finish?**
A: Talk to your instructor. We can adjust the timeline.

### **Q: Can I do this alone?**
A: Not for critical procedures. Instructor or partner required.

### **Q: What if I'm scared of breaking something?**
A: That's normal. The fear keeps you careful. Follow procedures = no breaks.
