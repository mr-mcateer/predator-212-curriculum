## 📍 What You're Actually Doing

### **The Big Picture**

You're going to:
1. **Take apart** a complete Predator 212 engine (down to individual components)
2. **Inspect** each part to understand what it does
3. **Measure** components to verify they're within specifications
4. **Put it back together** in precise order
5. **Adjust** critical components so the engine runs correctly
6. **Start the engine** and verify it works

### **Why This Matters**

This is **authentic work** that real mechanics do every day. You're not just learning about engines - you're actually rebuilding one.

---

## 🔴 Non-Negotiable Safety Rules

**These aren't suggestions. These are requirements.**

### **Before You Start Anything**

```
☑ Spark plug is removed (not just disconnected)
☑ All fuel is drained from carburetor
☑ All oil is drained (both drain plugs)
☑ Engine is COLD (not running for 30+ minutes)
☑ Workstation is clean and organized
☑ You have first aid kit nearby
☑ Fire extinguisher is accessible
☑ You're NOT working alone (instructor or partner present)
```

### **During Work**

```
☑ Safety glasses are worn
☑ Oily rags go in disposal container (not in trash)
☑ Spilled oil is cleaned immediately (slip hazard)
☑ Tools are used correctly (not improvised)
☑ You ask before trying something new
☑ You stop immediately if something feels wrong
```

### **STOP Work Immediately If:**

```
🔴 You're unsure about a procedure
🔴 You hear rod knock during startup (rapid metal-on-metal clicking)
🔴 You see fuel leaking
🔴 You see oil leaking where there shouldn't be
🔴 You can't get something to fit properly
🔴 Someone asks you to skip a safety step
```

## 🗓 Your Weekly Schedule

### **Week 1: Preparation**

```
Monday:   Read this file + take pre-assessment
Tuesday:  Review safety checklist + study teaching guide
Wednesday: Watch Mr. Hall Part 1 & 2 + study procedures
Thursday:  Study for knowledge check + prepare workspace
Friday:    Instructor review + get cleared to start disassembly
```

**Your job:** Understand the big picture before you touch anything

---

### **Weeks 2-3: Disassembly**

```
Day 1:  Remove external components (carburetor, air cleaner, valve cover)
Day 2:  Remove flywheel and crankcase cover
Day 3:  Remove internal components (piston, connecting rod, camshaft)
Day 4:  Remove head and valves
Day 5:  Inspection day - measure everything
        (Instructor signs off on inspection)

Your job: Be methodical, take photos, label everything
```

**Critical Documentation:**
- Photograph every component position
- Record where each bolt came from
- Measure ring gaps and bore
- Note component condition

---

### **Weeks 4-5: Reassembly (The Important Part)**

```
Week 4:
  Day 1-2: Head reassembly (valves, springs, head bolts)
  Day 3: ⭐ VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT ⭐ (Most critical!)
  Day 4-5: Internal assembly (camshaft, crankcase cover)

Week 5:
  Day 1-2: Flywheel and external components
  Day 3-4: Carburetor and fuel system
  Day 5:   Pre-startup verification
           (Instructor sign-off before startup)

Your job: Precision work - measure, document, verify
```

**⭐ SPECIAL ATTENTION TO VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT:**
This is THE most critical procedure. Poor valve lash = engine won't run right.
- Watch Mr. Hall Part 7 at least 2 times
- Follow the procedure exactly
- Record every measurement
- Get your instructor to verify

---

### **Week 6: Startup & Reflection**

```
Day 1:  Final assembly checks + pre-startup verification
Day 2:  First startup! 🚀 (Nervousness is normal)
Day 3:  Troubleshooting if needed
Day 4-5: Complete worksheet + answer reflection questions
```

**Your job:** Document the startup process, learn from it

---

## ⚙ Critical Concepts You Need to Know

### **Torque (NOT just "tight")**

Don't guess. Torque wrench = precision.
- Too tight = broken threads (aluminum is delicate)
- Too loose = parts falling off during startup
- Correct = engine works, nothing breaks

[Reference: docs/05-Torque-Specifications.md](docs/05-Torque-Specifications.md)

### **Valve Lash (Open + Close gap)**

This controls when valves open and close.
- Too tight = valves don't fully open (engine weak)
- Too loose = valves don't fully close (compression loss)
- Perfect = engine purrs

This is why we emphasize it so much.

### **Timing Marks (Everything aligns here)**

Before you disassemble, photograph the timing marks.
When you reassemble, align them exactly the same way.
Engine timing controls everything.

### **Ring Gaps (Measured in thousandths of an inch)**

Piston rings must have exact gaps.
- Too tight = rings stick (bad)
- Too loose = compression loss (bad)
- Just right = engine works (good)

## ❓ Common Questions

### **Q: What if I mess something up?**
A: Tell your instructor immediately. Most things can be fixed. Hiding problems causes bigger problems.

### **Q: What if the engine doesn't start?**
A: That's actually a learning opportunity. We'll troubleshoot together.

### **Q: Can I skip the valve lash adjustment?**
A: No. This is non-negotiable. Engine won't run right without it.

### **Q: What if I don't have time to finish?**
A: Talk to your instructor. We can adjust the timeline.

### **Q: Can I do this alone?**
A: Not for critical procedures. Instructor or partner required.

### **Q: What if I'm scared of breaking something?**
A: That's normal. The fear keeps you careful. Follow procedures = no breaks.
