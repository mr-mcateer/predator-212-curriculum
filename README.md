## 📝 YOUR NOTEBOOK FORMAT

**You must maintain a notebook (paper or printed)** containing:

1. **Phase 1: Preparation**
   - Safety agreement
   - Video notes
   - Pre-assessment
   - Tool inventory

2. **Phase 2-3: Disassembly**
   - Component list with condition
   - Measurements
   - Photos/sketches
   - Instructor sign-off

3. **Phase 4-5: Reassembly**
   - Valve lash measurements (CRITICAL)
   - Torque specifications
   - Timing verification
   - Instructor sign-offs

4. **Phase 6: Startup**
   - Startup notes
   - Reflection questions
   - Completion signature

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

1. **Mondays are quick planning/video sessions** - come prepared on Tue/Thu to actually work
2. **Tue/Thu blocks are your REAL work time** - use them productively
3. **Watch the videos WHILE working**, not just before
4. **Pause frequently** - don't try to watch and work simultaneously
5. **Write everything down** - your notebook is your proof of learning
6. **Get instructor sign-offs** at valve lash and reassembly checkpoints (your ticket to proceed)
7. **Don't rush valve lash** - this is 90% of why engines fail on startup
8. **Keep components organized** - confusion during reassembly causes problems
9. **Come to Tuesday/Thursday blocks ready to work** - Monday is just prep

## 🎓 ASSESSMENT

**You will be graded on:**

- **30%** - Safety adherence and procedures followed
- **25%** - Documentation completeness (your notebook)
- **20%** - Measurements and specifications accuracy
- **15%** - Engine startup success
- **10%** - Reflection and learning demonstrated

---

## 📞 HELP & TROUBLESHOOTING

**Something doesn't make sense?**
- Check the video first (watch the relevant section again)
- Ask your instructor
- Read the teaching guide for that section

**Engine won't start after rebuild?**
- 80% of startup problems = incorrect valve lash
- Check valve lash measurements first
- Verify timing marks are still aligned
- Confirm fuel is reaching carburetor

**Measurement doesn't match the guide?**
- Write down what you measured
- Show your instructor
- Don't guess - measure again if needed
- Document your actual measurement
