MOST CRITICAL CHECKPOINT
================================================================================

⭐ WEEK 3 WEDNESDAY - VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT

Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixVMH0u7C34 (watch TWICE)

SPECS:
  Intake:  0.003" - 0.005"
  Exhaust: 0.004" - 0.006"

PROCEDURE:
1. Position at Top Dead Center (TDC)
2. Use feeler gauge
3. Adjust rocker screw until snug
4. Record measurement
5. Rotate 180° and check other valve
6. Record both measurements

ACTION: DO NOT PROCEED to reassembly without:
  • Instructor verification
  • Both valve lash measurements correct
  • Student understanding (not just lucky)
  • Worksheet signed off

⚠️ This is why 80% of engines won't start if wrong. Get it right.

================================================================================

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING QUICK FIXES
================================================================================

Engine won't start?
→ Check: Spark → Fuel → VALVE LASH (most common)
→ See: docs/FAQ.md

Stuck bolt?
→ Apply penetrating oil, wait 15-30 min
→ Steady pressure, don't jerk

Stripped threads?
→ Can't fix easily - document in notebook
→ Discuss with student

Student confused?
→ See: docs/FAQ.md
→ Show relevant video section

================================================================================
DOCUMENTATION YOU NEED TO COLLECT
================================================================================

Each student should have in their worksheet:

□ WEEK 1: Safety agreement, pre-assessment, tool inventory
□ WEEK 2: Component removal sequence, measurements, photos
□ WEEK 3: Valve lash ALL attempts, torque values used
□ WEEK 6: Startup date/time, engine behavior, reflection

Check worksheets EVERY FRIDAY. Don't let documentation fall behind.

================================================================================
KEY TEACHER RESPONSIBILITIES
================================================================================

DAILY:
□ Safety observation (is anyone cutting corners?)
□ Technique verification (are they doing it right?)
□ Documentation check (are they writing it down?)

WEEKLY:
□ Friday: Collect and review worksheets
□ Friday: Quick spot checks of measurements
□ Friday: Verify all bolts were torqued correctly

CRITICAL DATES:
□ Week 1 Friday: Knowledge check must pass before disassembly
□ Week 2 Friday: Measurements must be recorded
□ Week 3 Wednesday: Valve lash MUST be verified by you
□ Week 3 Friday: All torque values must be documented
□ Week 6 Tuesday: Startup attempt (have extinguisher nearby!)
□ Week 6 Friday: Final grades

================================================================================
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
================================================================================

Student won't follow safety procedure?
→ STOP work immediately
→ Private conversation
→ Can't be a shortcut person - safety is non-negotiable
→ 30% of grade is safety adherence

Engine won't start?
→ Likely: Valve lash wrong (80% of cases)
→ Check spark, fuel, compression in order
→ See: docs/FAQ.md for diagnosis
→ Document troubleshooting attempts (shows learning)

Student behind schedule?
→ Can work at own pace if safety maintained
→ Can catch up with extra hours if available
→ Assessment based on quality, not speed

================================================================================
YOU'VE GOT THIS
================================================================================

This is a complete, turn-key curriculum. Everything you need is:

1. In this folder (all files offline-ready)
2. In docs/INSTRUCTOR_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (detailed daily activities)
3. On GitHub (backup + shareable link for students)

Monday morning: Print the guide, print student materials, you're ready.

Questions? Everything is documented in the guide.

Good luck. Your students are about to do real technical work.
