- Proper piston-to-rod alignment
- The importance of the piston pin locking mechanism

### Critical Measurements:
- Top compression ring gap: 0.008" - 0.020"
- Second compression ring gap: 0.008" - 0.020"
- Oil control ring: manufacturer specification
- **Gaps measured with piston in cylinder**

### Study Points:

---

## VIDEO 4: Reassembly of the Internals - Predator 212 CC Engine - Part 4

**Duration:** ~15 minutes
**Key Topics Covered:**
- Piston and rod installation into cylinder
- Connecting rod bolt tightening sequence
- Camshaft installation and timing mark alignment

### Critical Learning Points:
1. **Timing is Everything** - Marks must align at multiple rotation points
2. **Torque Values Matter** - Using too much force damages aluminum threads
3. **Sequence Matters** - Bolts must be tightened gradually in cross patterns
4. **Verification is Key** - Manually rotating engine after reassembly prevents startup disasters

### Common Issues Mr. Hall Addresses:
- Over-tightening bolts in aluminum
- Forcing the camshaft when it won't slide smoothly
- Not verifying mark alignment through full rotation

- Head gasket condition assessment

### Watch For:
- How to distinguish intake valve from exhaust valve
- The valve spring compression mechanism
- What a good valve seat looks like vs. damaged
- Importance of clean gasket surfaces

### Technical Details:
- **Intake valve** - larger, lower compression temperature
- **Exhaust valve** - smaller, higher temperature alloy
- Valve springs ensure closure when not actuated
- Gasket surface must be mirror-smooth for proper sealing

### Key Observation Points:
- Valve face condition (pitting indicates wear)
- Spring action (should be smooth and strong)
- Head flatness (warp indicates problems)

---

## VIDEO 6: Predator 212 Head Reassembly - Part 6

**Duration:** ~11 minutes
**Key Topics Covered:**
- Valve installation in head
- Valve spring installation
- Spring compressor usage
- Head bolt tightening sequence
- Gasket surface preparation

### Watch For:
- **Cross-pattern bolt tightening** mandatory for head bolts
- How Mr. Hall uses three-step torquing process
- Valve spring compressor proper usage
- Verification that valves move freely after assembly

### Critical Procedure:
1. Clean ALL gasket surfaces (no oil, dirt, old material)
2. Install new head gasket in correct orientation
3. Install head bolts hand-tight first
4. Torque sequence:
   - Pass 1: All bolts to 1/4 turn past hand-tight
   - Pass 2: All bolts to half specification
   - Pass 3: All bolts to full specification
5. Final verification that head sits flush

### Head Bolt Torque:
- **17-22 ft-lbs** (verify your manual)
- Aluminum threads are delicate
- **DO NOT over-tighten**

## VIDEO 7: Predator 212 Valve Lashing - Part 7

**Duration:** ~8 minutes
**Key Topics Covered:**
- **MOST IMPORTANT VIDEO FOR ENGINE PERFORMANCE**
- Valve lash definition and purpose
- Top Dead Center (TDC) positioning
- Feeler gauge technique
- Rocker arm adjustment procedure
- Critical measurements and specifications

### ⚠️ WHY THIS VIDEO MATTERS:
**Improper valve lash is the #1 cause of poor engine performance on reassembly!**

### Watch For (Multiple Times):
- How Mr. Hall positions the engine at TDC
- Using feeler gauge with correct "drag" feel
- Loosening rocker bolt without disturbing valve
- Sliding rocker to adjust gap
- Re-tightening and verifying adjustment doesn't shift

### Step-by-Step Procedure:
1. **Rotate crankshaft to Top Dead Center**
   - Piston at top of cylinder
   - Both valves fully closed
   - Usually marked on flywheel

2. **Check Intake Valve Lash**
   - Feeler gauge size: 0.003"
   - Should have SLIGHT DRAG
   - Gauge should not drop freely
   - Should not be too tight

3. **Adjustment Process (if needed)**
   - Loosen rocker arm bolt
   - Slide rocker on stud to change gap
   - Tighten bolt firmly
   - Re-verify measurement

4. **Check Exhaust Valve Lash**
   - Feeler gauge size: 0.004"
   - Slightly larger than intake
   - Same procedure as intake

### Specification Reference:
```
INTAKE VALVE:  0.002" - 0.005"  (typically 0.003")
EXHAUST VALVE: 0.003" - 0.006"  (typically 0.004")
```

### Key Point:
Mr. Hall emphasizes checking BOTH valves at TDC, then rotating the engine 180° (half turn) and checking them again. This ensures proper timing.

### Watch For:
- How tight the flywheel bolt actually is
- Need for helper or flywheel holder
- Final verification that nothing moves

### Critical Specification:
- **Flywheel bolt torque: 25-30 ft-lbs** (VERY tight)
- Requires firm tightening
- Loose flywheel bolt = catastrophic failure
