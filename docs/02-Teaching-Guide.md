## SAFETY FIRST: Pre-Disassembly Checklist {#safety-first}

### ⚠️ CRITICAL SAFETY STEPS - ALWAYS PERFORM FIRST

Before you touch this engine, complete these steps in order. **DO NOT SKIP ANY OF THESE.**

#### Step 1: Verify No Fuel in the System
- **Why:** Fuel vapors can ignite. Always drain the fuel system completely.
- **Location:** Carburetor bowl (bottom of carburetor)
- **Tools Needed:** 10mm socket
- **Procedure:**
  1. Locate the two screws holding the carburetor bowl
  2. Remove the bottom screw completely (removes the entire bowl)
  3. Locate the drain plug in the bowl
  4. **Place a catch pan or shop towel under the plug**
  5. Remove the drain plug - gas will pour out
  6. Verify the bowl is completely empty (tip it over into a bowl to check)
  7. Set gas shut-off valve to the "OFF" position to prevent tank drainage into bowl
  8. Only proceed when **completely dry**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDER:** Even a small amount of fuel can be dangerous. Take time with this step.

---

#### Step 2: Remove Spark Plug Cable & Spark Plug

- **Why:** Prevents engine from accidentally cranking; removes pressure hazards
- **Tools Needed:** 13/16" (21mm) socket with rubber insert
- **Procedure:**
  1. Locate spark plug cable on top of engine
  2. Grasp the rubber boot and **pull straight up** - it will pop off
  3. Locate the spark plug (under where the cable was)
  4. Place socket on spark plug - you should **feel it pop on**
  5. **Critical Point:** Do NOT apply lateral (side) forces to the ceramic part - it breaks easily
  6. Firmly but carefully break the plug loose, then remove by hand
  7. Set aside in a safe place

**🔧 TIP:** Always perform this on a **COLD ENGINE** - hot engines can burn you.

**⚠️ WHY THIS MATTERS:** The spark plug serves TWO safety functions:
- It's the source of ignition (we eliminate this)
- It seals cylinder pressure (removing it relieves pressure so the engine can't suddenly roll backward)

---

#### Step 3: Drain the Oil

- **Location:** Two oil drain plugs - one on each side of engine
- **Tools Needed:** 10mm socket
- **Procedure:**
  1. Place a **large catch pan** under the drain plug area
  2. Locate drain plugs on both sides
  3. Carefully remove one drain plug (oil will flow out)
  4. **Be prepared for oil flow - have towels ready**
  5. Remove the second drain plug and drain completely
  6. Factory engines always leave residual oil inside

**⚠️ OIL DISPOSAL:**
- Used oil must go into approved disposal containers
- Oily rags must go into the **red oily rag combustion container** in the classroom
- **NEVER** leave oil on the floor - creates slip hazards
- Clean up spills immediately with shop towels

---

#### Workstation Setup
Before starting:
- [ ] Clear your work area
- [ ] Have shop towels ready (use plenty)
- [ ] Know where disposal containers are located
- [ ] Have all metric sockets ready (10mm, 8mm most common)
- [ ] **Everything on this engine is metric except for one nut**

---

## PHASE 1: INITIAL PREPARATION & FUEL SYSTEM {#phase-1-initial-preparation}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 1 (0:00 - 10:00 approximately)

### Remove Air Cleaner Assembly

**Tools Needed:** 10mm wrench/socket

**Procedure:**
1. Locate the air cleaner (sits on top of carburetor)
2. Move the **choke lever to the LEFT** (toward engine center)
3. Move the **gas shutoff lever to the LEFT**
4. Locate and remove the 10mm bolt holding the air cleaner
5. Carefully lift the air cleaner off
   - There's a rubber boot connecting it - don't force it
   - Gently work it free

**📌 KEY POINT:** This is your first introduction to the metric fasteners you'll use throughout. Keep these small fasteners organized!

---

### Remove Carburetor Assembly

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket, adjustable wrench

**Procedure:**
1. The carburetor is held by bolts to the side of the engine
2. Locate and remove the 10mm bolts
3. **Carefully disconnect** any fuel line still connected
   - Have a rag ready to catch residual fuel
4. **Disconnect the throttle cable** (if equipped)
5. Lift carburetor away from engine - the inlet tube slides off

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** The carburetor inlet acts as the fuel intake. Keep this relatively clean to prevent debris entry.

**💡 WHY WE DO THIS:** Removing the carburetor:
- Prevents fuel contamination during disassembly
- Protects the carburetor from debris
- Gives us clear access to the engine block

---

### Remove Valve Cover (Cylinder Head Cover)

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket, screwdriver

**Procedure:**
1. Locate the bolts around the perimeter of the valve cover (top of engine)
2. Remove all 10mm bolts in a **cross pattern**
   - This prevents warping
   - Start in the middle, work outward
3. Carefully lift off the valve cover
4. **Save this gasket** - you'll reuse it (likely)

**⚠️ CAUTION:** There's oil inside under pressure. Have shop towels ready!

**📌 KEY OBSERVATION:** Notice the pushrods and valve springs under this cover - you'll see how they work during disassembly.

---

## PHASE 2: ENGINE TEAR DOWN - EXTERNAL COMPONENTS {#phase-2-external-components}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 1-2 (continuing)

### Remove Spark Plug Wire Housing/HT Lead

Once spark plug cable is off, there may be a housing:
- Remove mounting bolts
- Set aside carefully (it can crack)

---

### Remove Flywheel & Stator

**Tools Needed:** 19mm socket, flywheel puller (important!), torque wrench

**Procedure:**
1. Locate the large bolt in the center of the flywheel (crankshaft end)
2. This bolt may be VERY tight - use a breaker bar if needed
3. Remove the bolt and washer
4. **DO NOT PULL ON THE FLYWHEEL BY HAND**
   - Use a flywheel puller tool to extract it safely
   - The flywheel is heavy and critical
5. Note the stator (magnets) underneath - remove by unbolting
6. The flywheel has internal cooling fins - don't damage these

**📌 WHY:** The flywheel provides rotational mass and cooling. Damaging it causes balance problems.

---

### Remove the Crankcase Cover

**Tools Needed:** 10mm and 8mm sockets

**Procedure:**
1. Locate all bolts around the crankcase (right side of engine)
2. **Remove in a crisscross pattern** to prevent warping
3. Once bolts are out, carefully pry the cover off
   - May be sealed with gasket material
   - Take your time - don't break the mounting surface
4. **Have towels ready** - there's residual oil inside
5. Set cover aside on clean surface

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** This cover is aluminum and expensive to replace. Don't damage the sealing surfaces.

---

### Remove Oil Pump (if equipped)

**Procedure:**
1. Locate the oil pump (powered by camshaft)
2. Remove mounting bolts
3. Note the drive gear interface with the camshaft
4. Set aside - these can be rebuilt

---

## PHASE 3: INTERNAL DISASSEMBLY {#phase-3-internal-disassembly}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 2-3

### Remove Rocker Arms & Pushrods

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket

**Purpose:** Rocker arms control valve opening. You need them off to remove the cylinder head.

**Procedure:**
1. Locate rocker arm bolts (typically 2-3 per rocker)
2. Remove bolts in order - mark their positions
3. Carefully lift rocker arms up and away
4. **Remove pushrods** - note which rod goes where
   - Mark them (1, 2) or photograph position
   - These must go back in correct positions
   - Different pushrod lengths may indicate different valve trains
5. Place all components on a clean surface in order

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Rocker arms have specific left/right orientation. Photograph or label before removal.

---

### Remove Cylinder Head

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket, gasket scraper

**Critical Procedure - Multiple Steps:**

**Step 1 - Remove Head Bolts**
1. Locate head bolts around cylinder head perimeter
2. **Remove in a reverse order of a crisscross pattern**
3. Use three-step loosening:
   - First pass: Loosen all bolts 1/4 turn
   - Second pass: Loosen all bolts 1/2 turn
   - Third pass: Remove completely
4. This prevents warping the aluminum head

**Step 2 - Separate Head from Block**
1. Gently tap around the head with a rubber mallet
2. Use a gasket scraper at the gasket edge (not the sealing surfaces)
3. Lift head straight up - don't angle it
4. Place head on wooden blocks - don't rest on combustion surface

**Step 3 - Examine the Gasket**
- Note gasket condition
- Look for any blow-through (failure points)
- **Save gasket** - may be reusable if sealed properly

---

### Understand the Valve Train

**Now that the head is off, observe:**

1. **Intake Valve** - allows fuel mixture into cylinder
   - Opens when intake valve is raised
   - Connects to intake manifold

2. **Exhaust Valve** - allows burned gases to exit
   - Opens at end of combustion stroke
   - Connects to exhaust manifold

3. **Valve Springs** - push valves closed when not operated

4. **Pushrod Configuration:**
   - Different lengths indicate different valve actuation
   - Smaller rod = one valve type
   - Larger rod = other valve type
   - This is how the engine controls fuel/air and exhaust

---

### Remove Camshaft

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket

**Purpose:** The camshaft operates the valves via the rocker arms and pushrods.

**Procedure:**
1. Locate camshaft (runs horizontally through engine block)
2. Find camshaft gear/sprocket and mark timing position
   - **Take a photograph** - you need to reassemble at same angle
3. Remove camshaft bearing bolts
4. Carefully pull camshaft out
5. **Examine the lobes** (egg-shaped protrusions)
   - These push the pushrods
   - Different sizes = different valve timing

**📌 CRITICAL:** Mark the timing position on the camshaft gear. You must return it to the exact same position.

---

### Remove Connecting Rod (First Time Understanding)

**Tools Needed:** 10mm socket, 17mm socket

**Procedure:**
1. Locate connecting rod bolts at crankshaft end
2. Remove two bolts (one on each side typically)
3. Connect rod cap separates from rod
4. Mark which cap goes with which rod
5. Note the bearing surfaces inside

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** These bearings are precision components. Don't lose caps or mix them up.

---

### Remove Piston

**Tools Needed:** Gasket scraper, rubber mallet

**Procedure:**
1. Once connecting rod is unbolted, gently tap piston from cylinder
2. Use rubber mallet on connecting rod
3. Piston will slide out the top of cylinder
4. **Important observation points:**
   - Piston rings (three rings control compression and oil)
   - Piston skirt (bottom part)
   - Piston head (top - faces combustion)

---

## PHASE 4: PISTON & CYLINDER UNDERSTANDING {#phase-4-piston-and-cylinder}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 3-4

### Understanding Piston Rings

**Three Critical Rings:**

1. **Top Compression Ring** (topmost)
   - Purpose: Seals combustion pressure in cylinder
   - Extremely close tolerance to cylinder wall
   - Failure = loss of compression

2. **Second Compression Ring** (middle)
   - Purpose: Additional pressure seal
   - Backup if top ring fails
   - Works in conjunction with top ring

3. **Oil Control Ring** (bottom)
   - Purpose: Controls oil film on cylinder wall
   - Prevents oil from entering combustion chamber
   - Scrapes excess oil back to pan

**🔧 MEASUREMENT CRITICAL:**
- These rings must have specific gaps when installed
- Mr. Hall measures these in the videos
- Improper gap causes:
  - Stuck rings (too tight)
  - Loss of compression (too loose)

---

### Installing New Piston Rings

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 3 (Installing a Predator 212 Piston)

**Tools Needed:** Piston ring installer tool, micrometer (for gap measurement)

**Important Reminders:**

**⚠️ DO NOT:**
- Touch ring ends with bare hands (oil from fingers affects fit)
- Use pliers to spread rings (they're brittle)
- Force rings onto piston

**✓ DO:**
1. Use proper ring expanders/installers
2. Slide rings on smoothly with slight rocking motion
3. Measure ring gaps with piston in cylinder
4. Gap should be:
   - **Compression rings:** 0.008"-0.020" gap
   - **Oil ring:** Follow manufacturer specs

**Installation Sequence:**
1. Install oil ring first (bottom)
2. Install second compression ring (middle)
3. Install top compression ring last
4. Verify all rings rotate freely on piston
5. Check gap dimensions with feeler gauge in cylinder

---

### Cylinder Inspection

**What to look for:**

1. **Scoring** (scratches running vertically)
   - Light scoring: Can be honed
   - Heavy scoring: Cylinder may need replacement

2. **Bore Measurement**
   - Measure cylinder diameter at multiple points
   - Out-of-round condition requires boring/honing
   - Use inside micrometer for accurate measurement

3. **Cleanliness**
   - Must be spotlessly clean
   - Even small particles cause ring failure
   - Use lint-free cloths and air compression

**Cylinder Preparation:**
- Light honing to restore finish
- Complete cleaning afterward
- Apply light oil film to prevent rust

---

## PHASE 5: HEAD AND VALVES {#phase-5-head-and-valves}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 5-7

### Valve Identification & Function

**Intake Valve:**
- Location: Bottom of intake port
- Size: Typically larger (better airflow)
- Material: Steel alloy
- Function: Admits fuel/air mixture

**Exhaust Valve:**
- Location: Bottom of exhaust port
- Size: Typically smaller (less material needed)
- Material: Special alloy (higher heat tolerance)
- Function: Releases burned gases

---

### Valve Lashing Adjustment

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 7 (Predator 212 Valve Lashing)

**What is Valve Lashing?**
- Gap between valve stem and rocker arm
- Allows proper valve seating and operation
- Too tight: Valve won't fully close (loses compression)
- Too loose: Valve doesn't open fully (loses power)

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Improper valve lashing is a common cause of poor performance.

**Measurement Procedure:**

**Tools Needed:** Feeler gauge set, screwdriver, torque wrench

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Position Engine at Top Dead Center (TDC)**
   - Rotate crankshaft until piston reaches top
   - Both valves should be fully closed
   - Usually marked on flywheel

2. **Check Intake Valve Lash**
   - Insert feeler gauge between valve stem and rocker arm
   - Typical specification: **0.002" - 0.005"**
   - Gauge should have **slight drag** on rocker
   - Adjust by loosening rocker bolt and shifting rocker position

3. **Check Exhaust Valve Lash**
   - Same procedure as intake
   - Exhaust often has **slightly larger clearance**: **0.003" - 0.006"**
   - Reason: Exhaust runs hotter, needs more room for expansion

4. **Lock in Adjustments**
   - Tighten rocker bolts securely
   - Verify adjustments haven't shifted
   - Re-check both valves

**Adjustment Points:**
- Rocker bolt: Loosen to adjust lash
- Rocker position: Slide side-to-side on stud to change gap
- Lock down: Tighten firmly when correct

**⚠️ COMMON MISTAKE:** Setting lash too tight. A little loose is better than too tight.

---

### Valve Seal Inspection

**Why Sealing Matters:**
- Poor seal = compression loss
- Poor seal = oil burning
- Poor seal = rough running engine

**Inspection Points:**

1. **Valve Face** (bottom of valve)
   - Should have clean seat contact
   - Look for pitting or erosion
   - Light discoloration is normal

2. **Valve Seat** (in head)
   - Should be smooth and slightly polished
   - Roughness indicates wear
   - May need machining/replacement

3. **Valve Stem** (shaft)
   - Should be smooth
   - Any scoring requires valve replacement

**Cleaning:**
- Use soft wire brush (not steel wool)
- Light honing compound if needed
- Check fit - valve should drop with only gravity in seat

---

### Installing Valves Back

**Procedure:**
1. Install valve spring seat (if present)
2. Place spring under valve
3. Position valve in head
4. Install valve spring and retainer
5. Compress with spring compressor
6. Install valve locks (small clips)
7. Release compressor slowly
8. Verify valve operates freely

---

## PHASE 6: REASSEMBLY PROCESS {#phase-6-reassembly}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 4-6

### Connecting Rod & Crankshaft Assembly

**Tools Needed:** 17mm socket, torque wrench

**Critical Steps:**

1. **Prepare Bearings**
   - Inspect bearing surfaces on rod and cap
   - Look for scoring or wear
   - Light polishing acceptable if smooth finish

2. **Install Piston/Rod to Crankshaft**
   - Piston goes into cylinder bore
   - Connecting rod wraps around crankshaft journal
   - Bearing cap bolts from other side

3. **Tighten Bolts**
   - Use proper torque specification (typically 15-18 ft-lbs)
   - Do not guess - use torque wrench
   - Too tight: Bearing damage
   - Too loose: Rod knock (bearing failure in use)

4. **Verify Rod Movement**
   - Rod should rotate freely on crankshaft
   - Piston should slide freely in cylinder
   - No binding

---

### Install Camshaft with Correct Timing

**Critical Importance:**
- Camshaft timing controls when valves open/close
- Wrong timing = engine won't run
- Wrong timing = severe damage possible

**Procedure:**

1. **Study Timing Marks**
   - Mark on camshaft gear should align with mark on crankshaft gear
   - Mr. Hall photographs this position before disassembly
   - Recreate exact position

2. **Install Camshaft**
   - Carefully slide into engine block
   - Thread mounting bolts
   - Do not force - should slide smoothly

3. **Verify Timing**
   - Rotate both shafts together
   - Marks should maintain alignment throughout rotation
   - Check at multiple points

4. **Tighten and Lock**
   - Torque camshaft bolts to specification
   - Some engines use safety wire - install if present

**⚠️ TIMING IS EVERYTHING:** If valve timing is off, the engine won't start or will run very poorly.

---

### Install Pushrods

**Important Note:** Pushrods have specific lengths and positions.

**Procedure:**
1. Recall which rod goes where (you photographed earlier)
2. Slide rods into their respective holes
3. Lower end goes into lifter
4. Upper end goes under rocker arm
5. Verify they're fully seated at both ends

---

### Install Rocker Arms

**Procedure:**
1. Place rocker arms in position
2. Ensure pushrods are properly positioned
3. Thread rocker arm bolts
4. Tighten firmly but don't over-torque (aluminum threads)

---

### Install Cylinder Head

**Critical Assembly:**

1. **Prepare Gasket**
   - Clean head and block mating surfaces completely
   - No oil, debris, or old gasket material
   - Use gasket scraper carefully
   - Blow out with compressed air

2. **Install New Gasket** (always recommended)
   - Position gasket on block
   - Note intake/exhaust orientation
   - Some gaskets are one-way

3. **Position Head Carefully**
   - Lower head onto gasket
   - Align bolt holes precisely
   - Start bolts by hand first

4. **Tighten Head Bolts**
   - **Crisscross pattern is mandatory**
   - Torque in three passes:
     - Pass 1: Finger tight
     - Pass 2: Half spec torque
     - Pass 3: Full spec torque
   - Typical specification: 17-22 ft-lbs (confirm for your engine)
   - Aluminum threads are delicate - don't over-tighten

5. **Final Verification**
   - Head should sit flush
   - No gaps between head and block
   - All bolts equally tight

---

## PHASE 7: FINAL ASSEMBLY & TESTING {#phase-7-final-assembly}

**Video Reference:** Mr. Hall Part 8-9

### Install Valve Cover

1. Clean valve cover and mating surface
2. Install gasket (reuse if in good condition)
3. Position cover carefully over valves
4. Install bolts in crisscross pattern
5. Tighten snugly - don't over-tighten (can warp cover)

---

### Reassemble Crankcase Cover

**Procedure:**
1. Clean gasket surfaces completely
2. Install new gasket or reuse if seal intact
3. Position cover
4. Install bolts in crisscross pattern
5. Tighten gradually - ensure even seating
6. Check that oil level is correct

---

### Install Flywheel

**Tools Needed:** 19mm socket, flywheel holder (or friend to hold engine), torque wrench

**Important Note:** Flywheel bolt is VERY TIGHT (typically 25-30 ft-lbs or more)

**Procedure:**
1. Slide flywheel onto crankshaft tapered end
2. Install washer and bolt
3. Need someone to hold flywheel or use holder tool
4. Tighten bolt firmly and to specification

2. ✓ Fuel shut-off valve is ON
3. ✓ No fuel leaks visible
4. ✓ Intake manifold is sealed
5. ✓ All hose connections are tight
6. ✓ Oil level is correct
7. ✓ Spark plug is installed

---

### Cold Start Procedure

**First Run - Critical Steps:**

1. **Set Choke to ON** (cold start position)
2. **Prime the engine** (pull recoil several times without spark to draw fuel)
3. **Pull recoil cord firmly** - should crank
4. **Listen for ignition** - should hear spark plugs firing
5. **Once started, move choke to RUN** after 30 seconds
6. **Let idle for 2-3 minutes**
7. **Check for leaks immediately:**
   - Oil leaks
   - Fuel leaks
   - Coolant leaks (if equipped)
8. **Listen for unusual noises:**
   - Rod knock (metal-on-metal rapid clicking)
   - Valve clatter (normal on startup)
   - Pinging or detonation
9. **Stop and investigate** any abnormal sounds

---

### First Run Break-In

**First Hour Important:**
- Run at partial throttle only
- Do not stress engine
- Monitor temperature (should warm but not overheat)
- Check oil level after 15 minutes of running
- Oil level typically drops as oil reaches bearings

---

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### Engine Won't Start

**Check These First:**
1. ✓ Spark plug installed and gapped correctly?
2. ✓ Spark plug cable connected firmly?
3. ✓ Fuel reaching carburetor bowl?
4. ✓ Choke set to ON for cold start?
5. ✓ Compression present (pull cord has resistance)?

---

### Engine Starts but Runs Rough

**Possible Causes:**
1. Valve lash incorrect - adjust to specification
2. Ignition timing off - check camshaft timing marks
3. Fuel mixture wrong - check carburetor settings
4. Spark plug fouled - clean or replace
5. Compression loss - check piston rings and head seal

---

### Engine Knocking or Pinging

**Possibilities:**
1. Rod knock - connecting rod bolts loose (STOP ENGINE immediately)
2. Valve train clatter - normal on first startup, usually goes away
3. Carbon buildup - run cleaner fuel
4. Low octane fuel - use higher octane

---

### Oil Leaks

**Common Leak Points:**
1. Crankcase cover gasket - reseal or replace gasket
2. Valve cover gasket - reseal or replace gasket
3. Oil drain plug - may need new washer or resealing
4. Head gasket - may be blown (requires complete reseal)
