## CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS (Must Pass to Proceed)

These must be completed and verified by instructor before moving forward:

| Checkpoint | Week | Must Have |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| Safety Agreement Signed | 1 | Yes - Start of project |
| Pre-Disassembly Safety Checklist | 2 | Yes - Before touching engine |
| Valve Lash Measurements Verified | 4-5 | **YES - CRITICAL** (80% of startup problems come from this) |
| Engine Rotates Smoothly by Hand | 5 | Yes - Before startup attempt |
| Pre-Startup Verification Complete | 6 | Yes - Before first start attempt |

**If any critical checkpoint is not passed, student must revise work before proceeding to next phase.**
