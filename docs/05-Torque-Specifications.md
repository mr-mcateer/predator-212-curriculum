# 🔧 Torque Specifications - Predator 212 Engine

## Quick Reference for Reassembly (Week 4-5)

**CRITICAL:** Use a torque wrench for ALL bolts. Do not guess at tightness.

## 📋 Complete Torque Specifications Table

| Component | Torque Spec | Tool Required | Notes |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| **Head Bolts** | 17-22 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | Aluminum threads - don't over-torque |
| **Connecting Rod Bolts** | 15-18 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | Critical for engine balance |
| **Rocker Arm Bolts** | 10-12 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | After valve lash adjustment |
| **Crankcase Cover Bolts** | 8-10 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | Seal integrity important |
| **Valve Cover Bolts** | 6-8 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | Lowest torque - easy to strip |
| **Flywheel Bolt** | 25-30 ft-lbs | Torque wrench | VERY TIGHT - may need helper |
| **Spark Plug** | 12-15 ft-lbs | Socket | Don't over-tighten ceramic |

## 🎯 When to Apply Each Specification

### During Disassembly (Weeks 2-3)
- **Record EVERY torque spec** as you remove each bolt
- Write down the actual torque reading you removed it at
- This tells you what reassembly torque should be

### During Reassembly (Week 4-5)

#### Head Assembly (Tuesday Block, Week 4)
- Head bolts must be torqued in a **cross-pattern** (not circular)
- Three-pass procedure:
  - **Pass 1:** 50% of spec torque
  - **Pass 2:** 75% of spec torque
  - **Pass 3:** 100% of spec torque (17-22 ft-lbs)

#### Connecting Rod Bolts (Thursday Block, Week 4)
- Use 15-18 ft-lbs
- These are critical - engine balance depends on consistency
- If you stripped threads during disassembly, document this

#### Crankcase Assembly (Monday, Week 5)
- Cover bolts: 8-10 ft-lbs
- Work in a star pattern around the case
- Helps maintain seal integrity

#### Rocker Arm Assembly (Tuesday Block, Week 5)
- Apply 10-12 ft-lbs **AFTER** you complete valve lash adjustment
- Do this last - valve lash first, then torque rocker arms

#### Flywheel Installation (Thursday Block, Week 5)
- Flywheel bolt: 25-30 ft-lbs
- This is VERY TIGHT - may need a second person
- Use a flywheel holder or have a friend hold the engine
- Document: Did it slip? Did you need help?

#### Valve Cover (Optional, Week 6)
- If reinstalling factory cover: 6-8 ft-lbs
- Aluminum threads strip easily - go low end of spec

#### Spark Plug (Week 6, Before Startup)
- 12-15 ft-lbs
- Over-tightening can crack ceramic insulator
- Use a socket with rubber insert to avoid damage

## ⚠️ CRITICAL TORQUE MISTAKES

### Too Tight ❌
- **Symptom:** Thread strips, bolt spins freely when trying to tighten
- **Problem:** Aluminum engines strip easily
- **Fix:** If stripped, document it and ask instructor
- **Prevention:** Use torque wrench, don't "feel" the tightness

### Too Loose ❌
- **Symptom:** Bolts fall out, components rattle, oil leaks
- **Problem:** Loss of seal integrity or component separation
- **Fix:** Re-torque to spec
- **Prevention:** Always use torque wrench

### Inconsistent ❌
- **Symptom:** Engine vibrates, head bolts come loose after startup
- **Problem:** Uneven clamping forces stress the aluminum
- **Fix:** Re-torque all bolts to spec
- **Prevention:** Use same torque wrench throughout project

## 🔍 How to Use a Torque Wrench

### Setting the Wrench
1. Set the desired torque value on the wrench handle
2. **Double-check** the reading before starting
3. Different wrenches have different scales - verify yours

### Applying Torque
1. Place socket on bolt
2. Apply steady, even pressure
3. **STOP** when you hear/feel the click
4. Back off slowly - wrench clicks when limit is reached
5. Do NOT continue tightening after the click

### Recording Your Work
**In your notebook, for EACH bolt you torque, write:**
- Bolt location
- Torque specification applied
- Actual torque wrench reading
- Any difficulties (stuck bolt, stripped thread, etc.)

## 📝 Student Documentation Requirements

### Week 4 Reassembly Phase
- [ ] Recorded actual removal torques from disassembly
- [ ] Applied correct torque specs during head assembly
- [ ] Documented 3-pass cross-pattern procedure for head bolts
- [ ] Applied connecting rod torque (15-18 ft-lbs)
- [ ] Noted any stripped threads or bolt problems

### Week 5 Final Assembly Phase
- [ ] Completed crankcase bolts (8-10 ft-lbs)
- [ ] Applied rocker arm torque AFTER valve lash adjustment
- [ ] Installed and torqued flywheel (25-30 ft-lbs)
- [ ] Recorded if flywheel needed helper/holder
- [ ] Installed spark plug with correct torque (12-15 ft-lbs)

### Critical Checkpoint
- [ ] **Instructor verification:** All critical bolts verified with torque wrench before startup attempt

## 🎓 Why Torque Specifications Matter

**For Small Engines:**
- Aluminum cylinder heads expand differently than steel bolts
- Over-torque = stripped threads = unfixable without boring new holes
- Under-torque = leaks and vibration = poor running

**For Your Grade:**
- Documentation of torque specs = 20% of "Measurements & Specifications Accuracy"
- Proper application = critical to engine startup success
- Recording actual values vs. specs shows understanding

**For Real-World Work:**
- Professional mechanics always use torque wrench
- Manufacturer specs exist for a reason
- "Close enough" doesn't work in engines
