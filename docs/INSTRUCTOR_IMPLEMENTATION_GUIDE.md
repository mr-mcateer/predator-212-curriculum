## TROUBLESHOOTING REFERENCE {#troubleshooting-reference}

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Engine Won't Start After Rebuild**

First check (in order):
1. Spark plug cable connected?
2. Fuel in tank and flowing?
3. **Valve lash incorrect?** (Most common - 80% of failures)

Solution: Recheck valve lash with feeler gauge
- Intake: 0.003-0.005"
- Exhaust: 0.004-0.006"

**Engine Starts But Dies Immediately**

Likely causes:
- Fuel issue (old/bad fuel, carb flooded)
- Air filter issue
- Magneto timing off

First attempt: Add fresh fuel, retry

**Engine Runs But Very Rough**

Check:
- All bolts torqued correctly (esp. head bolts)
- Spark plug gap correct (0.025-0.030")
- Valve lash uneven between intake/exhaust
- Carburetor idle adjustment

**Bolt Won't Come Out During Disassembly**

Solutions:
- Apply penetrating oil, wait 15-30 min
- Use correct size socket (no wobble)
- Get teacher to hold engine steady
- Steady pressure, don't jerk
- Last resort: Heat with heat gun (teacher approval only)

**Stripped Threads (Aluminum)**

Prevention (during reassembly):
- Use torque wrench, not "feel"
- If bolt spins freely, STOP
- Document it in notebook
- Discuss with teacher

Cannot be fixed easily - requires helicoil or larger bolt

**Valve Lash Won't Adjust Into Spec**

Most common: Valve seat worn, can't fully open/close

- Measure 3 times to verify
- If still wrong, document in notebook
- Discuss with teacher
- May require valve replacement (beyond scope)

```

**WEEK 6 CHECKLIST:**
```
☐ Engine starts within 5-10 pulls
☐ Runs smoothly without major issues
☐ All documentation complete
☐ Reflection questions answered thoroughly
☐ Self-assessment completed
☐ Final cleanup done
```

### Handout 2: Valve Lash Quick Reference

```
VALVE LASH ADJUSTMENT QUICK REF

Intake valve gap:   0.003" - 0.005"  (thin feeler)
Exhaust valve gap:  0.004" - 0.006"  (slightly thicker)

PROCEDURE:
1. Position engine at Top Dead Center (TDC)
2. Loosen rocker arm screw
3. Slide feeler gauge under rocker arm
4. Adjust screw until gauge is snug (slight drag)
5. Record measurement
6. Rotate engine 180° (half turn)
7. Check and adjust other valve
8. Record both measurements
9. Get teacher verification BEFORE PROCEEDING

If valve lash is wrong:
- Too tight: valves don't open fully
- Too loose: compression loss, won't run right

MUST BE CORRECT - THIS IS #1 REASON ENGINES DON'T START
```

### Handout 3: Torque Wrench Instructions

```
HOW TO USE A TORQUE WRENCH

SETTING:
1. Look at wrench scale
2. Find desired torque value
3. Turn handle to set exact value
4. Double-check setting before starting

USING:
1. Place socket on bolt
2. Apply steady, even pressure
3. LISTEN for click
4. STOP when you hear/feel click
5. Back off slowly

COMMON TORQUES FOR THIS PROJECT:
- Head bolts: 17-22 ft-lbs (3-pass cross pattern)
- Connecting rod: 15-18 ft-lbs
- Rocker arms: 10-12 ft-lbs
- Crankcase cover: 8-10 ft-lbs
- Flywheel: 25-30 ft-lbs (very tight!)
- Spark plug: 12-15 ft-lbs

IMPORTANT: Aluminum threads strip easily!
→ Use torque wrench, don't guess
→ If bolt spins freely, STOP and get help
```
