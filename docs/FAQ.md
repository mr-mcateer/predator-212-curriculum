## 🚀 STARTUP PROBLEMS

### Q: My engine won't start at all. What do I do?

**First, check these in order:**

1. **Check the spark plug**
   - Is cable connected?
   - Did you reinstall it correctly?
   - **Test:** Remove spark plug - touch connector to engine ground - pull cord firmly - see spark?
   - No spark = check ignition system, not valve lash

2. **Check fuel system**
   - Is there fuel in the tank?
   - Is the fuel line connected?
   - Did you open the fuel valve (if equipped)?
   - **Test:** Disconnect fuel line into carb - pull cord to see if fuel sprays out
   - No fuel = check fuel line and valve

3. **Check valve lash** ⚠️ **MOST COMMON REASON**
   - Valves too tight = no air/fuel gets in, no exhaust gets out
   - Valves too loose = compression loss, no power
   - **Test:** Recheck with feeler gauge - both intake AND exhaust
   - Did you verify your measurements with instructor BEFORE startup?
   - **80% of startup failures are valve lash problems**

4. **Check compression**
   - Does engine feel hard to pull (shows compression)?
   - Or does it spin easy (no compression)?
   - **Test:** Pull cord with spark plug removed - should feel solid resistance
   - Easy pull = valve timing issue or compression leak

5. **Check ignition timing**
   - Are the timing marks aligned?
   - Did you photograph them before disassembly?
   - **Test:** Remove spark plug, slowly rotate engine to TDC - marks should line up
   - Marks don't line up = camshaft installed wrong or timing chain off

---

### Q: Engine starts but dies immediately. What does that mean?

**This usually means fuel or air problem:**

1. **Check air filter** (if equipped)
   - Is intake filter clogged?
   - Remove it and try running - if it runs better, filter is issue

2. **Check fuel quality**
   - Is fuel fresh (less than 30 days old)?
   - Old fuel = gum buildup in carburetor
   - **Test:** Drain carb bowl, add fresh fuel, try again

3. **Check carburetor**
   - After disassembly, sometimes bowl isn't sealed right
   - **Test:** Is fuel leaking from under carburetor?
   - If yes, reseat bowl with new gasket

4. **Check magneto (ignition)**
   - Is it timed correctly?
   - **Test:** With engine off, slowly rotate to TDC - mark should align with reference
   - If you moved magneto during disassembly, it needs re-timing

---

### Q: Engine runs but very rough/vibrates a lot. What's wrong?

**This indicates imbalance or tuning issue:**

1. **Check all bolts are torqued correctly**
   - Head bolts loose = combustion leak = rough running
   - **Test:** Go around and re-torque all critical bolts
   - Head bolts especially - use cross-pattern

2. **Check spark plug gap**
   - Did you clean/re-gap spark plug correctly?
   - Gap should be 0.025-0.030" (25-30 thousandths)
   - **Test:** Measure with feeler gauge - too wide = hard to start, too tight = weak spark

3. **Check carb idle adjustment**
   - Idle screw too rich or lean?
   - **Test:** Slow idle screw while running - find smoothest running point
   - Document what position gave smoothest running

4. **Check compression unevenly**
   - One valve looser than other?
   - Causes uneven firing = vibration
   - **Test:** Recheck BOTH valve lashes - must be within spec

---

### Q: Pulls hard to start. What does that mean?

**Hard pull indicates high compression or timing issue:**

1. **Engine is over-compressed**
   - Valve lash too tight? Reduces heat loss, increases compression
   - **Test:** Check feeler gauge clearances again
   - Intake should be 0.003-0.005", Exhaust 0.004-0.006"

2. **Carburetor flooded**
   - Too much fuel in bowl
   - **Test:** Remove spark plug and pull cord to clear out excess fuel
   - Try starting again after clearing

3. **Ignition timing retarded**
   - Magneto installed wrong = timing off
   - Hard start = timing is too late
   - **Test:** With spark plug out, rotate to TDC and verify timing mark alignment

---

### Q: Engine runs only for a few seconds then stops. Why?

**Usually fuel starvation:**

1. **Fuel tank vent is blocked**
   - Without vent, tank can't breathe = fuel stops flowing
   - **Test:** Remove fuel cap - engine runs longer? That's your problem
   - Solution: Make sure vent line has no blockage

2. **Carburetor float is stuck**
   - Float valve won't open = fuel stops flowing
   - **Test:** Tap carb bowl gently while running
   - If that helps, float is stuck
   - Solution: Remove bowl and clean float mechanism

3. **Fuel filter clogged** (if equipped)
   - Blocks fuel flow after brief running
   - **Test:** Remove fuel line and blow through it
   - Resistance = filter is clogged

## 🔧 DISASSEMBLY & REASSEMBLY PROBLEMS

### Q: I stripped the threads on an aluminum bolt hole. Can I fix it?

**Stripped threads cannot be reversed. Discuss with instructor.**

**Options:**
1. Use next size larger bolt (may not be available)
2. Use a thread insert (helicoil) - but this requires special tool
3. Document it in your notebook - shows troubleshooting skills
4. This is why torque specs are critical - prevents stripping

**Prevention for next bolt:**
- Use torque wrench, not "feel"
- If bolt spins freely when tightening, STOP immediately
- Go to instructor before continuing

### Q: The connecting rod bolts won't come out. They're stuck.

**Do NOT force them - you'll break something.**

1. **Try penetrating oil**
   - Spray with penetrating oil (PB Blaster, WD-40)
   - Wait 15-30 minutes
   - Try again with steady pressure (not jerking)

2. **Use correct socket size**
   - Wrong size socket can strip the bolt head
   - Verify you have exactly the right size
   - Should fit tight with no wobble

3. **Get helper**
   - Have instructor hold engine steady
   - Your torque needs to be steady, not jerking
   - Easy pressure beats hard jerking

4. **Heat as last resort**
   - Only if instructor approves
   - Heat expands metal, helps loosen corrosion
   - Use heat gun or hot water, not open flame

### Q: I can't get the piston ring in the groove. What's wrong?

**Piston rings must go in at an angle, then spread apart.**

1. **Start at an angle**
   - Don't go straight down
   - Slide ring in at 45° angle from the side
   - Gradually rotate as it goes in
   - Support the ring - don't let it fall and bind

2. **Use ring expander**
   - Special tool to spread ring while inserting
   - Makes it much easier
   - Ask instructor if available

3. **Go slowly**
   - Ring can break if forced
   - You only get 3 rings - don't waste them
   - If ring binds, back out and try again

4. **Check ring order**
   - Compression rings different from oil rings
   - Usually compression rings go on top
   - Check your photos from disassembly

---

### Q: Valve cover won't seal after reassembly. Is it leaking oil?

**This usually means gasket or seal issue:**

1. **Check gasket condition**
   - Did you replace the valve cover gasket?
   - Old gaskets won't reseal
   - New gasket needed if original is damaged

2. **Check bolt torque**
   - Valve cover bolts: 6-8 ft-lbs (lowest spec - easy to strip)
   - Too loose = leaks
   - Too tight = you'll strip aluminum
   - Use torque wrench

3. **Clean the sealing surface**
   - Old gasket material must be removed completely
   - Use scraper or wire brush
   - Old material prevents seal

4. **Install new gasket correctly**
   - Gasket must sit flat in groove
   - Bolt it down in a star pattern
   - Tighten gradually - don't cinch one side first

## 📊 MEASUREMENT & DOCUMENTATION PROBLEMS

### Q: My ring gap measurement doesn't match the spec. What does this mean?

**Ring gap measures how tight compression is:**

- **Gap too small** (<0.001") = Risk of ring seizing - bad
- **Gap in spec** (0.005-0.015" for most engines) = Good
- **Gap too large** (>0.025") = Compression loss - engine weak

**If gap is wrong:**
1. Verify you measured correctly - gap at top of stroke
2. Document what you measured in your notebook
3. Discuss with instructor before assembly
4. Larger gap = less compression = harder to start
5. Smaller gap = risk of ring sticking

**This affects your grade:**
- Measuring correctly = Measurements & Specifications Accuracy (20%)
- Including what you found = Documentation (25%)

---

### Q: I forgot to document a step. Can I go back and write it now?

**No - documentation must be WHILE you do the work, not after.**

**Why this matters:**
- Your notebook shows you actually did the work
- Added details now look fake
- Instructor can tell when writing was done
- Dates/times matter for grading

**What to do:**
1. Document everything going forward
2. In your notebook, briefly explain what happened
3. Date it with today's date
4. Ask instructor if this affects your grade
5. Going forward: write while you work, not after

---

### Q: Do I have to write down EVERY measurement, or just the ones that matter?

**Write down EVERY measurement - even the ones that seem wrong.**

**Why:**
- Shows you did the actual work
- Shows your troubleshooting process
- Incorrect measurements often point to assembly mistakes
- Instructor wants to see ALL your attempts, not just successes

**What to write:**
1. Date and time you took measurement
2. Actual measurement you got
3. Specification from the guide
4. If it matches or doesn't match
5. What you did about it
6. Any help you got from instructor

**Example:**
- "Monday, 2/10, 2:15pm - Measured intake valve lash: 0.008\""
- "Spec is 0.003-0.005\". Too loose!"
- "Adjusted rocker screw counterclockwise"
- "Remeasured: 0.004\" - now in spec ✓"

## 🎓 ASSESSMENT & GRADING QUESTIONS

### Q: How much of my grade depends on my engine actually running?

**Engine startup success = 15% of grade**

- A: Engine starts on first or second attempt, runs smoothly
- B: Engine starts after 3-5 attempts, needs minor adjustment
- C: Engine starts after 5-10 attempts, runs rough
- D: Engine won't start or starts then dies
- F: Engine doesn't start at all

**But if engine doesn't start, you can still get good grades on:**
- Safety adherence (30%) - always achievable
- Documentation (25%) - you control this
- Measurements accuracy (20%) - mostly your work
- Reflection (10%) - shows you learned

**So even if startup fails, you can still get a C or B if other areas are strong.**

---

### Q: I really messed up one section. Will that tank my grade?

**No - your grade is calculated in five parts:**

1. **Safety (30%)** - Easiest to control, just follow procedures
2. **Documentation (25%)** - You control this completely
3. **Measurements (20%)** - Do the work carefully
4. **Startup (15%)** - Depends on quality of earlier work
5. **Reflection (10%)** - Show you learned something

**Example scenarios:**
- Bad startup (0%) + excellent everything else (95%) = about 76% = C (because startup is only 15%)
- Great startup (100%) + poor documentation (50%) = about 79% = C+ (documentation pulls you down)
- Average everything (80%) = 80% = B

**You have control over at least 80% of your grade.** Startup is only 15%.

### Q: What if I made a real mistake during disassembly? Do I have to tell the instructor?

**YES - Tell instructor immediately.**

**Why:**
- Instructor needs to know to help you fix it
- Documenting mistakes shows integrity
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Hiding them makes things worse

**What gets documented:**
1. Stripped threads
2. Broken components
3. Lost or mixed-up parts
4. Measurement errors
5. Assembly mistakes

**In your notebook write:**
- "Found stripped thread on head bolt"
- "Happened during disassembly when forced bolt"
- "Discussed with instructor on [date]"
- "Solution: [what instructor decided]"

**This helps your grade because:**
- Shows honesty
- Shows problem-solving
- Shows learning from mistake
- Extra credit opportunity: "Troubleshoot and fix startup problem (+5 points)"

## 🔗 WHEN TO ASK FOR HELP

### Ask Instructor IMMEDIATELY If:

- ⚠️ Safety concern (fuel smell, sharp edges, electrical risk)
- 🔧 Bolt or component breaks
- 🚫 Measurements don't make sense (way off spec)
- 📏 Valve lash won't adjust into spec
- ❓ Don't know how to use a tool
- 🚗 Engine won't start after you've tried troubleshooting
- 📝 Unsure what to write in notebook

### Try to Troubleshoot First:
- Ring gap in wrong range (check your measurement technique)
- Engine hard to pull (recheck valve lash)
- Bolt won't come out (try penetrating oil)
- Carb leaking (check bowl seal)
- Hard to remember where part goes (check your photos)
