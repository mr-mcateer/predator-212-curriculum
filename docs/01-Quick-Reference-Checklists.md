## COLD START PROCEDURE

### First Startup - Follow Exactly

```
PREP:
☐ Ensure work area is clear
☐ Remove anyone not needed
☐ Have fire extinguisher nearby
☐ Wear safety glasses

COLD START SEQUENCE:
1. Set choke to ON (full choke position)
2. Prime engine by pulling recoil 3-5 times WITHOUT spark
3. Pull recoil cord firmly with full motion
4. Engine should sputter and fire after 2-5 pulls
5. Once running, move choke to RUN after 30 seconds
6. Let idle for 1-2 minutes

FIRST RUN MONITORING:
☐ Listen for ignition sounds (spark plugs firing)
☐ Monitor exhaust (should be light smoke, not heavy)
☐ Watch for fuel leaks (stop if present)
☐ Listen for rod knock (rapid metallic clicking - STOP if heard)
☐ Verify oil pressure light (if equipped)
☐ Allow engine to warm to normal temperature
☐ Run at partial throttle only (first 10 minutes)

FIRST RUN OBSERVATIONS:
☐ Engine idles smoothly?
☐ No oil leaks detected?
☐ No fuel leaks detected?
☐ Normal exhaust color?
☐ Smooth acceleration?
☐ No unusual noises?
```

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

```
DISASSEMBLY:
✗ Forgetting to remove spark plug (fire hazard)
✗ Not draining fuel/oil completely
✗ Forgetting to photograph timing marks
✗ Not labeling components
✗ Forcing stuck components (soaking with penetrant instead)

INSPECTION:
✗ Not checking ring gaps
✗ Skipping valve lash adjustment
✗ Not verifying timing mark alignment
✗ Not cleaning surfaces properly before reassembly

REASSEMBLY:
✗ Not using torque wrench (guessing at tightness)
✗ Wrong reassembly sequence
✗ Forcing components together
✗ Not using new gaskets
✗ Cross-threading soft aluminum threads

STARTUP:
✗ Starting engine before verifying fuel/oil
✗ Starting with no valve lash adjustment
✗ Ignoring rod knock (continuing to run)
✗ Over-choking engine (too much fuel)
```

## STUDY QUESTIONS - Self-Check Your Knowledge

After completing this project, you should be able to answer:

```
1. Why must we remove the spark plug before disassembly?
2. What is the purpose of valve lash and what happens if it's wrong?
3. How many piston rings are on this engine and what does each do?
4. What is the purpose of the camshaft and how does it work?
5. Why is timing mark alignment critical?
6. What does connecting rod failure look like while running?
7. Why must head bolts be torqued in a crisscross pattern?
8. What is TDC and why does it matter for valve adjustment?
9. Why do compression rings have gaps between their ends?
10. What would you do if you heard rod knock during first startup?
```
