## 🔧 CRITICAL CHECKPOINTS

### Valve Lash Adjustment (Week 3 Wednesday)

**Why it matters:** 80% of engine startup failures are due to incorrect valve lash

**Specifications:**
- Intake valve gap: 0.003" - 0.005"
- Exhaust valve gap: 0.004" - 0.006"

**Procedure:**
1. Position engine at Top Dead Center (TDC)
2. Use feeler gauge
3. Adjust rocker screw until snug
4. Record measurement
5. Rotate 180° and check other valve
6. Get instructor verification BEFORE proceeding

**Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixVMH0u7C34 (watch 2-3 times)
